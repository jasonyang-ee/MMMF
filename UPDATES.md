# Major Updates - October 4, 2025

## Five Critical Fixes Implemented ✅

### 1. ✅ Recurring Transactions with Day of Month

**What Changed:**

- Added "Day of Month" field (1-31) to recurring transaction form
- Recurring transactions now automatically generate for each month within the forecast date range
- Shows "Day X of month" indicator on recurring items
- Auto-generated transactions are marked as "Recurring" in the timeline

**How It Works:**

- When you create a recurring transaction with day 15, it will automatically create a transaction on the 15th of each month from today until the forecast end date
- Handles months with fewer days (e.g., day 31 in February becomes day 28/29)
- Prevents duplicates if you manually add the same transaction

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/RecurringList.jsx` - Added dayOfMonth input field
- `src/utils.js` - Added `generateRecurringTransactions()` function
- `src/App.jsx` - Integrated auto-generation logic

---

### 2. ✅ Balance Timeline - Removed Chart

**What Changed:**

- Removed the visual chart/graph completely
- Timeline is now a clean table format
- Focus is purely on date and balance data

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/BalanceTimeline.jsx` - Removed all chart/SVG code

---

### 3. ✅ Balance Timeline - Centered and Enhanced

**What Changed:**

- Timeline is now centered on the webpage
- Added dedicated "Date" column (prominently displayed)
- Added "Action" column for delete buttons
- Added "Amount" column showing transaction amounts
- Added "Balance" column (the main focus) showing remaining balance
- Table format with clear headers

**Column Structure:**

1. **Action** - Delete button (far left)
2. **Date** - Transaction date
3. **Description** - Transaction name
4. **Amount** - +/- transaction amount
5. **Balance** - Remaining balance after transaction (emphasized)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/BalanceTimeline.jsx` - Converted to table format

---

### 4. ✅ Delete Buttons in Timeline

**What Changed:**

- Each manually-added transaction has a delete button in the far-left "Action" column
- Auto-generated recurring transactions show "Auto" label instead (cannot be deleted)
- Delete button removes the transaction immediately

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/BalanceTimeline.jsx` - Added delete functionality
- `src/App.jsx` - Passed delete handler to timeline

---

### 5. ✅ New Layout Arrangement

**What Changed:**
Complete reorganization of the page layout:

**Left Sidebar (Top to Bottom):**

1. Account Balance card
2. Forecast Settings card

**Center (Main Area):**

- Balance Timeline (table format, centered)

**Right Sidebar (Top to Bottom):**

1. Add Transaction form
2. Recurring Transactions list

**Removed:**

- Transaction List tile (deleted as requested)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/App.jsx` - Completely restructured layout grid
- Uses 12-column grid: 3 (left) + 6 (center) + 3 (right)

4. Click "Save Recurring Transaction"
5. Watch it automatically appear on that day each month in the timeline!

### Managing Timeline

## Technical Details

### Auto-Generation Logic

```javascript
// Generates transactions for each month from today to forecast end date
// For a recurring transaction with dayOfMonth = 15:
// - October 15, 2025
// - November 15, 2025
// - December 15, 2025
// ... and so on until forecast end date
```

### Key Functions

- `generateRecurringTransactions()` - Creates monthly transactions
- Each recurring item has unique ID: `recurring-{templateId}-{timestamp}`
- Marked with `isRecurring: true` flag
- Won't duplicate manual transactions

   - Added dayOfMonth to data structure

4. **src/utils.js**
