## Security Best Practices When Deploying

### Docker Deployments

- Use official images from Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry
- Keep the Docker daemon updated
- Run containers with the least required privileges
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration (never hardcode secrets)

### Network Security

- Never expose the application directly to the internet without authentication
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) with TLS/SSL
- Use Cloudflare Access or similar services for added security

### Data Security

- Limit file system permissions on the host
- Don't mount excessive volumes into the container
