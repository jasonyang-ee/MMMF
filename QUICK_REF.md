## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I delete auto-generated recurring transactions?**
A: No, they're managed by the recurring template. Delete the template to stop generating.

**Q: What if I need rent on different days each month?**
A: Add manual transactions for those specific months, or create multiple recurring items.

**Q: Does it handle different month lengths?**
A: Yes! Day 31 in February becomes Feb 28 (or 29 in leap years).

**Q: Where did the Transaction List go?**
A: It's been removed. Use the Balance Timeline (center) to see all transactions.

**Q: Can I still drag recurring items?**
A: Yes! Drag them to quickly add, but they now also auto-generate monthly.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

→ Check that your forecast end date is in the future

**Delete button not working?**
→ Auto-generated items can't be deleted (look for "Auto" label)

**Recurring item not showing?**
→ Verify you entered a day of month (1-31)

**Wrong balance showing?**
→ Check that all transactions have correct dates and types
