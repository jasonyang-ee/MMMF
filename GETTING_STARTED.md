## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Balance Calculation

```
Starting Balance: $5,000
+ Credits (Income): +$4,000
- Debits (Payments): -$2,200
= Forecasted Balance: $6,800
```

### 2. Transaction Flow

```
User Input → API Server → JSON File → Calculate → Display
```

### 3. Data Persistence

All data is stored in `data/` folder:

- Survives app restarts
- Easy to backup
- Human-readable JSON

- `settings.json` - Your starting balance

**Backup this folder regularly!**
